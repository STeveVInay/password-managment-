# password-management
----------------------
This tool will help you in generating passwords using username or length or strength (i.e. weak, medium, strong)
Instead of saving in browser and hackers tried to steal them from browser by many ways 
This tool will encrypt all you data using AES algorithm 
All you need to do is give URL u you need and username and length of password or strength of password
By default it takes user name as the length of password and saves in a encrypted file with password without password it cannot be opened
But the thing is whenever you try to login/register to any site then you want to go then always you have to open the file and check the password and copy and paste it in username/password fields

#Requirement

python2 or 3

python --url <site-url> -u <username> -l <password length>

python --url <site-url> -u <username> -m <weak, medium, strong> (password strength )
